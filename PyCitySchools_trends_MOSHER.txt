The first trend I noticed in the data was that 'school type' 
influenced student performance.  The highest performing schools were
all charter schools and the lowest were district, no matter the per 
student budget nor the total number of students at the school.  I would 
like to get more data on the support for teachers, and economic and 
racial information of students to better understand why charter schools 
perform better.

I also noticed that both math and reading scores remained consistent for
a school through all four years (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th).  The average 
per school generally remained within one point.  I, again, would want 
more information on what may be influencing this and whether it is about 
the students abilities or the different standards for grading at the
different schools.
